We don’t do anything different on the weekends as far as our patrol geography. We’re responsive to our community’s complaints. We focus on the quality of life in the neighborhoods as far as noise and traffic, behavior, criminal mischief. Most of our calls on the weekends are about complaints. People will call about a loud party or a disorderly group.</DD>

The initial contact is to find the homeowner and say ‘Hey, can you turn the noise down, could you bring people inside?' If it’s too loud, 'Hey, you have to disperse.' And we find most people are really cooperative. If you’re having a huge party at your house, the next person has a huge paper due. We try and find the balance.</DD>

If you’re going to drink at a bar, do it at a bar. If you’re going to do it at a house, do it at a house. Is there anything necessarily against the law? No, there’s not. But it’s not necessarily the smartest thing to do that kind of thing. Trash is an issue.The biggest thing we find is trash&mdash;cups thrown down, bottles thrown down.
